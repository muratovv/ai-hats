# ai-hats-rack

Minimal backlog kernel (epic HATS-1014, child K1 / HATS-1020), built **parallel** to
`ai-hats-tracker` — same `task.yaml` format, new engine. The kernel is a light FSM plus
transactional machinery, shipped with the K2 doc store (fs-as-truth view + frozen pins)
and project-root resolver; everything else (worktree, ownership, scaffold, plan-gate,
epic-automation, bash hooks) is an extension subscribing to kernel events.

## Transition pipeline

```
FileLock(task) → FSM-guard → in-memory mutation → in-lock subscribers → SINGLE persist (last)
                                                                       → lock release
                                                                       → post-lock subscribers
```

- **Single persist is unbypassable by construction**: subscribers get an immutable state
  copy + return a delta; they hold no store reference. Any raise before the persist means
  zero bytes changed on disk (heirs of HATS-723 / HATS-481 / HATS-866-AC3).
- **Bare kernel = pure FSM**: `Kernel(tasks_dir)` with no subscribers walks the full
  lifecycle with no side effects (heir of HATS-866/AC4). Unit tests never need git.
- **`force` relaxes only the FSM arrow** and requires a reason (journaled). It is passed
  to subscribers as information, never as a safety-off switch (HATS-518/596/697).
- **backlog.yaml is the SSOT** of the topology (9 states; reclaim `execute→execute`, reopen
  `done→execute`, `blocked` hub, `cancelled` exits). Editing it edits the kernel contract.
  The tasks discipline requires `document` (PROP-012), enforced at composition via
  `requires_states` (ADR-0017 §3) — an HYP/PROP topology without it loads. Invalid
  transitions answer with the legal edges.

## Subscriber contract

```python
class MyExtension:
    name = "my-extension"
    def subscriptions(self) -> list[Subscription]:  # (event_key, phase, priority)
        return [Subscription("edge:plan--execute", Phase.IN_LOCK, priority=10)]
    def on_event(self, ctx: DispatchContext) -> Delta | None:
        ...  # return a Delta, None, or raise AbortOperation("actionable reason")
```

- `DispatchContext` carries: `event`, `task` (deep copy), **`caller_cwd`** (mandatory;
  subscribers never read `Path.cwd()` — HATS-840), **`is_epic`** (recomputed from the
  current child-set on every dispatch — HATS-794/977/979), `actor` (who triggered:
  `session:…` / `agent:…` / `human:…`), `force` + `reason`.
- **in-lock** phase: blocking; `AbortOperation` → typed `OperationAborted` with the
  actionable reason (the reason channel); any other exception propagates raw. Either way
  nothing is persisted. There is no catch-and-warn mode for this phase.
- **post-lock** phase: reactions after persist + lock release. Failures are journaled as
  `error` outcomes — reported, never swallowed, never aborting. Post-lock extensions may
  drive further kernel calls (one task lock at a time, never nested — HATS-690 rule).

## Event registry (name-your-consumer, PROP-030)

| Event key                       | Fired by                                                           | Named consumer                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edge:<from>--<to>`             | `Kernel.transition`                                                | K3 core extensions (plan-gate, ownership, worktree in-lock; epic-automation, views post-lock); K4 hook-runner                                                         |
| `epicify`                       | `Kernel.create` / `Kernel.set_parent` (child gained)               | K3 ownership + worktree reconciliation handlers (idempotent release / `discard_if_empty`, HATS-977/979)                                                               |
| `pre-destroy`                   | extensions via `Kernel.publish`                                    | K3 guards on irreversible ops (abort / extract before worktree merge-discard, PROP-047/058)                                                                           |
| `link:<kind>` / `unlink:<kind>` | `Kernel.transition_ops` `--link`/`--unlink` (owning side, in-lock) | declared `links.kinds[].handlers` (e.g. a dep-cycle-check); fires only for a kind that declares handlers — the cross-backlog mirror `link-target:<kind>` is HATS-1044 |

A new event lands in this table together with its subscriber, or it does not land.

## Stock extensions (K3, HATS-1022)

Pure extensions live in `ai_hats_rack.extensions` (no integrator/wt/git imports):

- **plan-scaffold / plan-gate** — one config-driven section catalog feeds both,
  so template and enforcement can never drift (HATS-635); the gate names every
  empty required section, waives epics (HATS-794) and reopen (HATS-328).
- **frozen-integrity** (HATS-1031) — in-lock on EVERY edge (the full state
  product, forced edges included): scans the task's frozen pins and aborts any
  transition whose pinned document changed or vanished; the reason carries the
  document name, both digests and the recovery recipe
  (`transition <ID> --freeze <name> --ack-frozen` / `--rm <name> --ack-frozen`).
  No waivers — force, epics and automation actors do not bypass evidence
  integrity. Priority 8: after the ownership single-slot guard, before the
  plan-gate.
- **stamp-lifecycle / clear-lifecycle** (HATS-1043) — declaration-bound in-lock
  field stamps (replacing the old `kernel._stamp_lifecycle` hardcode): `done` /
  `cancelled` `on_enter: [stamp-lifecycle]` writes `completed_at` (config
  `field:`) via `Delta.fields`; the reopen edge's `clear-lifecycle` clears it and
  logs "Reopened from done".
- **epic-automation** — post-lock; the pure `decide()` table maps every epic
  source state × child trigger to reopen/advance/activate/no-op
  (HATS-690/692/789) and drives the epic through journaled FSM-valid kernel
  hops under the `rack:epic-automation` actor (also the anti-cascade guard).
- **derived-views** — post-lock STATE.md regeneration, own lock, atomic replace.

`standalone_extensions()` composes the standalone kit from the packaged
`backlog.yaml` declarations (frozen-integrity + plan-scaffold + plan-gate +
stamp/clear-lifecycle); ownership/worktree ship on the integrator side.

Ownership and worktree adapters depend on the integrator's wt engine and live
on the integrator side (`ai_hats.rack_wiring`, with `build_rack_kernel()` as
the assembly mirror of `cli/_helpers._task_manager`); the boundary stays
one-directional — the rack never imports them.

## Declaration-bound handlers (HATS-1043, ADR-0017 §3–§4)

`backlog.yaml` binds handlers where the edge is declared — the file says what
fires where. Four slots, expanded to subscriptions by the loader:

- `states[].on_enter` / `on_exit` — the FULL `edge:<src>--<state>` /
  `edge:<state>--<dst>` product (forced non-topology edges included, HATS-518); a
  declared self-loop (`reclaim`) is in the product, an undeclared one is not.
- `edges[].handlers` — one exact edge; `edges[].skip: [name]` opts that edge out
  of an on_enter/on_exit handler (the declarative reopen `skip: [plan-gate]`).
- `links.kinds[].handlers` — in-lock on link/unlink of that kind
  (`link:<kind>`/`unlink:<kind>`); may abort the mutation.

Every referenced name resolves through one open factory registry
(`stock_factories()` + integrator closures); an unknown name is a typed,
fail-closed `UnknownHandlerError`. A reference is a bare name or
`{name, priority?, ...config}`: unpinned refs get a positional band (100, 110,
…); an explicit `priority:` pins the number into the one total in-lock order.
The packaged kit pins today's chain — frozen 8, plan-gate 10, stamp/clear 12,
scaffold 30 — so migration is zero behaviour change. Optional contract hooks a
handler may expose: `bind(kernel)` (post-lock kernel handle) and
`requires_states()` (its state vocabulary, validated fail-closed at composition).

## Lock model (deadlock excluded structurally)

| Lock                      | Scope                                         | Holder    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `tasks/<ID>/.lock`        | transaction window: guard → in-lock → persist | kernel    |
| `tasks/.alloc.lock`       | atomic id alloc+reserve (HATS-936)            | kernel    |
| resource locks (git/base) | inside the owning extension's operation       | extension |

Rules: in-lock subscribers have **no API to take locks** (max one task lock held at any
time); post-lock subscribers are notified **after** release; acquisition order is always
task lock → resource lock; every kernel lock uses the single loud-fail timeout (30s).

## Journal

Every dispatch produces a `DispatchRecord` (event, task, actor, force+reason, one
outcome per subscriber: `ok` / `delta` / `abort` / `error`). Records ride the result of
every mutating call, including aborted dispatches. `JournalSink` is the persistence seam
— its consumer is **K7 audit log** (below); the bare kernel persists nothing.

### Audit log (K7)

The CLI attaches `JsonlJournalSink`: every dispatch appends one JSON line (schema `v: 1`:
ts, event, detail — edge from/to / epicify child / pre-destroy operation —, actor,
force+reason, per-subscriber outcomes, `result: persisted|aborted`, identity block) to
`tasks/<ID>/audit.jsonl`, size-rotated into `audit-NNN.jsonl` segments. Lossless by
contract (PROP-004): nothing is truncated or deleted. The identity block carries the
writing process's `AI_HATS_SESSION_ID` + `AI_HATS_ROOT_PID`, a verdict against the
claimed actor (`verified`/`mismatch`/`unverified` — blind zones are marked, PROP-080),
and an ownership-holder cross-check when `ownership.json` exists (PROP-076). Journal
write failures are loud on stderr but never break the already-persisted operation.
`rack context <ID> --attr audit` (`--event/--since/--actor`) is the query surface; it
warns when a task moved states with an empty journal (zero-events, PROP-005/076).

## CLI

Four verbs, each with `--json` (JSON-first, HATS-1031 API-D surface):

| Verb                   | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rack create <title>`  | new card; `--id/--parent/--depends/--tag/...`; initial state from backlog.yaml                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `rack ls [<ID>]`       | backlog scan (`--grep/--tag/--state/--parent`; `--backlog <name>` / `--all-backlogs` pick which mounted backlog(s), HATS-1080) or graph walk (`ls <ID> --deep N [--link <glob>…]`, repeatable OR)                                                                                               |
| `rack context <ID…>`   | THE read package: full card + top-level `links` + document paths; repeatable `--with <glob>` embeds, `--attr audit\|work_log`. Batch (`context ID1 ID2 …`, ≥2 ids) assembles all in one process → `{"contexts": {id: …}}`, skip-and-continue; one id stays unwrapped byte-identical (HATS-1074) |
| `rack transition <ID>` | THE mutating verb: an ordered composite of ops under one lock                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

`transition` ops run in **argv order** under ONE task lock with a single persist;
effects of earlier ops are visible to later ones, any abort rolls the whole
sequence back (HATS-1030):

| Op                        | Effect                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--state <s>`             | FSM edge (guard + two-phase dispatch); `transition <ID> <s>` is sugar for it     |
| `--attach <src>[:n]`      | copy a file into `tasks/<ID>/` as document `n` (default: basename)               |
| `--freeze <name>`         | pin `{name, digest, frozen}`; re-pinning drifted content requires `--ack-frozen` |
| `--rm <name>`             | trash the document (recoverable, HATS-470); a frozen one requires `--ack-frozen` |
| `--log <msg>`             | append a work_log entry                                                          |
| `--link <kind>:<id>`      | add an edge of any configured, non-derived kind (default kind: `related`)        |
| `--unlink [<kind>:]<id>`  | remove the edge(s) to `<id>`                                                     |
| `--set <field>=<value>`   | write a declared card field (schema-validated; `int` fields coerce)              |
| `--append <field>=<json>` | append a JSON entry to a declared list field (rides the same lock/persist)       |

Command-level flags: `--force` (+ mandatory `--reason`) relaxes the FSM arrow only;
`--resolution` / `--final-state` stamp terminal metadata; `--ack-frozen` is the tiered
frozen hatch shared by `--rm` and `--freeze`.

The backlog root is resolved by a walk-up from CWD to the nearest ancestor
holding `.agent/` or `ai-hats.yaml` (K2, HATS-197 heir); from inside a linked
task worktree (neither marker present) a pure-filesystem gitlink hop resolves
the main checkout instead (HATS-1038 C2). `ai-hats.yaml` supplies `ai_hats_dir`
and `task_prefix`. Resolution never mkdirs, and outside any project it answers
with a typed `no_project_root` error instead of bootstrapping a phantom tracker
(HATS-839 heir). `--tasks-dir` / `RACK_TASKS_DIR` stay as the explicit override
(still anchoring `project_dir` at the real root, C2 gap #3).

```
$ rack transition HATS-001 done --tasks-dir tasks
error: Invalid transition for HATS-001: brainstorm → done. Legal edges from 'brainstorm': plan, blocked, cancelled
```

### Backlog-as-filter on the scan (HATS-1080)

The no-id scan defaults to the **tasks** catalog (byte-for-byte its legacy output).
`--backlog <name>` scans a single mounted backlog instead, resolved dynamically
against the workspace (`cli_alias` or `name` — the same token that names the write
group below), so any sibling `backlog.yaml` resolves with no CLI change; an unknown
name is a typed `unknown_backlog` error listing what is mounted. `--all-backlogs`
scans every mounted backlog, each row carrying a `backlog` marker (a leading column
in human output, a `backlog` key in `--json`; both absent on the default tasks scan,
which stays annotation-free). This is the read-side mirror of the write-side groups
— one "backlog = dimension" model. Filters stay read-tolerant: `--tag`/`--parent`/
`--state` on cards that lack the value simply exclude them (never an error), and
`--state` self-narrows to the backlogs whose vocabulary uses the value.

### Per-backlog groups (HATS-1036 R2/R5, ADR-0017 §4/§7)

Every NON-tasks backlog the workspace mounts (`tracker/**/backlog.yaml`, HATS-1044)
becomes a group named after the backlog — the packaged `hypotheses` / `proposals`
read as their short CLI names `hyp` / `proposal`. Ids route by prefix, so
`transition`/`context`/`ls` already reach them; the group adds their write verbs.
The **base surface stays exactly the four verbs until a sibling catalog is
mounted** — nothing appears in a tasks-only repo. A group carries:

- `create` — schema-driven from the backlog's `fields[]` (required/choices/default
  enforced write-strict), the generic field mapping supplies e.g. `--hypothesis`.
- `update <ID> --<field>` — scalar edits mapped onto the `transition --set` field
  ops (one mutating path; `int` fields coerce, choices are schema-validated).
- the verbs its extensions contribute through the optional `verbs()` hook —
  `hyp append-verdict` / `hyp autoclose [--k --dry-run]`, `proposal vote`.

Old `ai-hats task` → `rack` mapping (the cutover collapses onto this surface):

| Old (`ai-hats task …`)        | New (`rack …`)                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hyp create --hypothesis …`   | `rack hyp create --hypothesis …`                        |
| `hyp append-verdict <ID> …`   | `rack hyp append-verdict <ID> --verdict … --evidence …` |
| `hyp autoclose [--k]`         | `rack hyp autoclose [--k --dry-run]`                    |
| `hyp update <ID> --<field> …` | `rack hyp update <ID> --<field> …`                      |
| refute / confirm / stall …    | `rack transition <ID> <edge-name>` (named edges)        |
| `proposal create …`           | `rack proposal create --category … --target … …`        |
| `proposal vote <ID> …`        | `rack proposal vote <ID> --reasoning … --session-id …`  |
| accept / reject / defer …     | `rack transition <ID> <edge-name>`                      |

`append-verdict`/`vote` take the entry fields as named options (the 80% path,
schema-validated) with a `--entry <json>` escape hatch for extra keys;
`--session-id` defaults to the ambient `AI_HATS_SESSION_ID` so quorum counting
works out of the box.

### Field edits — coexistence with `ai-hats task` (cutover, HATS-1038 C3)

The tasks backlog stays **flat** (no `update` verb): a declared field is edited in
place with `rack transition <ID> --set <field>=<value>` / `--append`, and the
tracker's `ai-hats task update <ID>` still writes the same `task.yaml` during the
cutover. What lives where:

| Edit                                                             | Home                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| state, work_log, documents (attach/freeze/rm), links, resolution | `rack transition <ID> --…`     |
| a declared card field (priority, reviewer, role, tags, …)        | `rack transition <ID> --set`   |
| new card + initial parent                                        | `rack create …`                |
| title / re-parent (no schema field / anchor move)                | `ai-hats task update <ID> --…` |

Both CLIs read and write the same `task.yaml` under the same task lock, so the
split is safe to interleave within one task.

## Doc store (K2, rev4 semantics)

**fs-as-truth**: the only way to write a document is to write a file into
`tasks/<ID>/` — `doc put`/`doc cat` do not exist. The ledger is a **view**:
`rack context` live-scans the directory (dotfiles and `task.yaml` excluded; legacy
`attachments/` blobs simply appear) and digests on the fly, so a directly-written
file is visible immediately — no registration, no write→register race.

- `rack context <ID>` prints a `Documents` block: name + **absolute path** + mtime +
  frozen mark (`frozen ✓` / `frozen ✗ modified|missing`); `--json` adds size,
  `sha256:<12hex>` digest and `drift`. Discovery, not injection — content is never
  inlined without `--with`; the agent reads by path (the 210K-character baseline F4
  lesson). Verification is internal: every context/ls checks pins; there is no
  `verify` verb. The read surface only FLAGS drift — the frozen-integrity extension
  (above) is what blocks transitions on it.
- freeze/rm are `transition` ops (table above): pins persist in task.yaml under the
  task lock; removal trashes to `$TMPDIR` (recoverable), never hard-deletes.

## Card fields (schema, HATS-1035, ADR-0017 §1–§2)

Everything beyond the engine anchor (`id`, `state`, `title`, `work_log`,
timestamps, links) is declared in `backlog.yaml` `fields[]`; `create` requires
only a non-empty `title`. A field entry:

```yaml
fields:
  - { name: priority, type: str, default: medium, choices: [low, medium, high, critical] }
  - { name: votes, type: any, validator: prop-vote-entries, default: [] } # any + a validator
  - { name: resolution, type: str, default: "", emit: when-set }          # dropped when empty
extras: forbid # top-level: reject unknown keys on WRITES (default: allow)
```

`type` is `str | int | list | any`; a complex shape is `any` + a mandatory
`validator: <name>` resolved through the open registry (unknown → fail-closed at
composition). **Writes are strict** — `create`, a transition's touched fields,
and subscriber `Delta.fields` ops validate against the schema (required / choices
/ type / validator); a violation is a typed refusal that persists nothing.
**Reads stay tolerant** — an old card breaking `choices` still loads (a `context`
warning, never a load failure). `emit: when-set` drops an empty value at persist
(the packaged nine keep `to_dict`'s behaviour, held by a parity pin).

## Data format

Reads/writes the tracker's `task.yaml` unchanged; unknown keys (e.g. the legacy
`attachments` manifest) round-trip verbatim via `extras`. Old cards load with
defaults. The only K2 addition is the `documents:` list of frozen pins.

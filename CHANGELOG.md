# Changelog

All notable changes to ai-hats are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versions are produced from git tags via `setuptools-scm`; everything
since the latest tag lives under **Unreleased** until the next release.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Built-in library moved from `src/ai_hats/libraries/` to a root-level
  `library/` directory and split into two layers: `library/core/`
  (engine fundament — system roles, base traits, global rules,
  foundational skills, all pipelines + injections, provider
  templates) and `library/usage/` (curated content catalog —
  opinionated roles, domain traits, opt-in skills). Both ship inside
  the installed `ai_hats.library` sub-package; no runtime behavior
  change for users. The split documents the engine/content boundary
  and unblocks future content-package extraction. (HATS-363)
- Python module `ai_hats.library` (containing `LibraryResolver`) was
  renamed to `ai_hats.resolver` to free up `ai_hats.library` as a
  data sub-package. Import updates: `from ai_hats.resolver import
  LibraryResolver`. (HATS-363)
- All user-facing docs (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the `docs/how-to-*.md`
  set, and the diagram-preview pages) are now English-only. The
  README hints that browser auto-translate handles other languages
  cleanly. (HATS-352)

### Added

- `docs/extending.md` — new guide for authoring own roles / traits /
  rules / skills, override-precedence chain, and replacing system
  roles. (HATS-363)

### Removed

- `docs/README.ru.md`. Browser translation replaces the maintained
  Russian mirror. (HATS-352)
- `docs/migration.md` (pipx → launcher) and `docs/migration-311.md`
  (v3 → v4 layout). Migration tooling is no longer a project flow:
  breaking changes ship cleanly per release, and both legacy
  migrations are long past. References in README and `docs/how-to.md`
  removed. (HATS-356)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-16

First public release. The repository, its history, and its docs have
been audited for sensitive data; an English-first landing page has
been added; the public surface (CLI, `ai-hats.yaml` schema, tracker
format, skill format) is documented and SemVer-protected. CI gates
every PR.

### Added

- `LICENSE` — MIT license.
- `SECURITY.md` — disclosure channel and supported-version policy.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev setup, commit conventions, and a "what not to
  commit" section that complements the privacy pre-commit hook.
- `docs/RELEASING.md` — SemVer policy, breaking-change protocol, and the
  manual release checklist.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — internal model (components, composition,
  task state machine, project structure, library layout, skill format).
- `docs/how-to-orchestration.md` — fan-out scenarios, session tags,
  `--json` output, exit-code contract.
- `docs/README.ru.md` — Russian README for native-language readers.
- `docs/assets/` — logo (multiple sizes + SVG silhouette), social-card
  PNG (1280×640), demo GIF/MP4, and a `README.md` with the regeneration
  pipeline (Gemini prompt, ImageMagick post-processing, vhs invocation).
- `scripts/demo.tape` — vhs script that records the README hero demo
  from real ai-hats state (config status → session list → active hyps).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug report + feature request) and
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions pipeline: ruff lint, test
  matrix (Python 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13) with a **78% coverage gate**,
  bandit (`-ll`) + pip-audit security scan, install-smoke that runs
  `scripts/install-launcher.sh` on a clean runner.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly pip + github-actions update PRs.
- `pyproject.toml`: `license = "MIT"`, `license-files`, `authors`,
  PyPI classifiers; `setuptools` build requirement bumped to ≥77 so the
  PEP 639 `license-files` key resolves; `[dev]` extras now include
  `bandit>=1.7` and `pip-audit>=2.7`; `[tool.coverage.*]` +
  `[tool.bandit]` configs.
- Privacy hook: new patterns for Claude session markers
  (`sessionId` / `requestId`, `"cwd": "/...`, structural JSONL keys like
  `parentUuid` / `toolUseResult`) plus a lower size threshold for new
  fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.
- README CI status badge.

### Changed

- `README.md` is now English-first; the Russian version moves to
  `docs/README.ru.md` with a language switch in both. README trimmed
  from 554 lines to ~125 — most reference-grade content moved to
  dedicated `docs/*.md` files.
- `docs/migration-333.md` renamed to `docs/migration.md`; this is the
  canonical migration guide. References in `README.md`, `docs/how-to.md`,
  and `docs/migration-311.md` updated.

### Removed

- Internal-ticket references in user-facing prose (`HATS-NNN` tags in
  README, the "repo is still private" warning).
- The duplicated "how to update ai-hats in a project" block in README
  (already covered by the Quick-start step 3).

### Security

- **Fix CWE-377 / bandit B306 in `providers.py`:** switched from
  `tempfile.mktemp` (TOCTOU race — between `mktemp` returning the path
  and `write_text` creating the file an attacker on the same host
  could pre-create it) to `tempfile.mkstemp`, which atomically opens
  an fd at mode 0600.
- Purged `tests/fixtures/real_conversation.jsonl` from working tree and
  from the entire git history. The fixture carried a real Claude Code
  session: absolute `cwd`, `sessionId`, `requestId`, subscription tier,
  and unredacted user prompts.
- Stopped tracking `tests/fixtures/real_conversation.jsonl` and
  `tests/fixtures/real_trace.log` via `.gitignore` so debug captures
  cannot land again.
- Rewrote git history with `git filter-repo`:
  - dropped the fixture from every commit reachable from any ref,
  - replaced `/Users/<dev>/dev/...` paths with `/path/to/...` in blob
    diffs and commit messages,
  - rewrote author / committer email to `f@muratovv.me` (438 commits
    re-hashed).
- Pre-commit privacy hook hardened with Claude-session detection
  (`sessionId` / `requestId` / `cwd` / structural JSONL keys) and a
  lower soft-warn threshold for new files in `tests/fixtures/`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04 / pre-public

The state of the project before the public-release sweep. Tracked
in detail in the git log and the on-disk `tracker/` backlog (HATS-001
through HATS-340). Headline themes:

- Venv-first launcher architecture (HATS-333..340).
- Pipelines and composer subsystem (HATS-261..287).
- Reflection / feedback loop and the session-reviewer role.
- Multi-provider injection (Claude and Gemini).
- Worktree isolation for sub-agents.
- Tracker primitives: tasks with a state machine, hypotheses (HYP),
  proposals (PROP).

This entry is intentionally terse — versions before the public release
were maintained in a private repository and documented in commit
messages rather than this changelog. The Unreleased section above is
where the public changelog history starts.
